IB Math HL IA - Hacking RSA (kinda)
===============
Usage
----------------
Replace n with the semiprime you wish to factorize.

How does it work?
----------------
This script uses 2 methods to factorize semiprimes.
- Brute Force Method
- Fermat's Factorization Method

For more details, visit the wiki.

Limitations
----------------
The code can only factorize a 9-digit number.

Sample output
----------------
````
n = 938065379
FF: 9613 is a factor
FF: 97583 is another factor
FF: Total execution time: 2ms
FF: steps involved: 11485
BF: 9613 is a factor
BF: 97583 is another factor
BF: Total execution time: 0ms
BF: steps involved: 4805
````
